Data Parallel Reduction

1.  How many times does your thread block synchronize to reduce its portion
    of an array to a single value?




2.  What is the minimum, maximum, and average number of "real" operations
    that a thread will perform? "Real" operations are those that directly
    contribute to the final reduction value, i.e., iterations of the reduction
    computation.
